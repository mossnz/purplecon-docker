## h*ck yeah containers

[@alicegoldfuss](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss) says that  
containers are _processes_  
born from _tarballs_  
anchored to _namespaces_  
controlled by _cgroups_

~~~notes
Alice Goldfuss has a talk called "the containers operator's manual",

"Containers are made up of a bunch of native Linux features stapled together"

Rather than being magic boxes, containers are standing on the shoulders of giants to make up their abstractions.

And if you're at Kiwicon tomorrow, we'll hear about the regrets of making Docker and the choices made for those abstractions from Jess Frazelle

~~~
---
## Abstractions are friends

Today we'll be dealing with
- docker pull
- docker push
- docker build
- docker run
- docker-compose up

~~~notes
We still want to learn about what "shoulders of giants" we're standing on,
But we can start working _now_ and get to that as we continue learning

You definitely want to know your abstractions when you're operating software.

## All good code needs a good problem

you have 1337 limes. definitely hax but ok.

let's solve this by uploading the limes to the cloud.

---
## https://try.redis.io

~~~
> incr limes
(integer) 1
> incr limes
(integer) 2
~~~

~~~notes
When I was submitting this talk, I pulled a service you can containerise out of thin air. Redis, I said.

Then it turns out that redis solves the problem I came up with.

## https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/
### $ docker run --name some-redis -d redis:latest

### $ docker run -it --link some-redis:redis --rm redis redis-cli -h redis -p 6379
~~~
redis:6379> incr limes
(integer) 1
redis:6379> incr limes
(integer) 2

### $ node index.js
~~~
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');
~~~

~~~notes
Reaching for my most comfortable tooling.

export default Split

~~~javascript
express.put('/limes', (res) => {
  redis.incr('limes', (reply) => {
    const limes = reply || 0;
    res.json({
      limes,
    });
  });
});
~~~

~~~notes
And then we write a callback pyramid because Javascript

If there's no reply from redis, just say we have no limes.

Now that we have minimally viable limes, it's time to draw the rest of the owl.

aka, Let's push this to _production_

But first, a history lesson on computing.

## Reflections on Trusting Trust
To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software.

— Ken Thompson. 1984. (Turing Award Lecture)
---
## 1. Programs can write programs.

~~~notes
A "quine", a program which outputs itself.
~~~
---
## 2. The C compiler is written in C

~~~notes
Compilers are programs that write programs.

Including, the compilers themselves.
~~~
---
## 3. We can modify a compiler to deliberately alter programs

The actual bug I planted in the compiler would
match code in the UNIX "login" command. The replacement
code would miscompile the login command
so that it would accept a particular known password.
---

## 3. We can modify a compiler to deliberately alter programs 

... including the compiler, that compiles the compiler.

~~~notes
Inception noise.

At this point, rather than just have a malicious compiler for login,

We write a malicious compiler for the _compiler_, so if you compile a compiler it will 
miscompile the UNIX "login" command
~~~
---
## The moral of this story is you can't trust code you didn't build yourself.

~~~notes
And public docker containers are definitely code we didn't build ourselves.

The typical security advice is to _not_ use public containers.

Which means if you've got a minimally viable product using public containers, you must then stop and rebuild them from scratch...
~~~

 If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe. 

 — Carl Sagan. Cosmos.

~~~notes
And we really don't want to invent the entire universe

So, what can we do to progressively build up trust in containers, 
While not stopping the world to rebuild from scratch?

## Minimally Viable Pipeline

By introducing a CI Pipeline, we can make small steps towards trusting our containers

Very Important to pause and watch the dogs.
